# Work Day Scheduler

As a busy employee, it is important to keep on top of your daily tasks. With this Work Day Scheduler App, you can do just that. 

The scheduler allows you to see the current date and time at the top of the page with clear instructions on the app's functions and interface.

Scrolling down, you can see the schedule with hours within the typical workday: 9AM - 5PM. Besides the hour is an input field where you can type your schedule item. You can also save the schedule item by clicking the button next to it.  The item will be stored in your browser's localStorage even after refreshing the page.

Another great feature is that the app also allows you to view a color codedschedule based on the time of day. Input fields for hours that have past will be gray. Input fields with hours that are in the future will display red. In the photo below, the times are altered to fit the display accordingly to the time the photo was taken.

A final feature would be the "Clear All" button at the top of the schedule. After clicking it, your entire schedule along with the localStorage will be wiped clean for you to start again the next day.
